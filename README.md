### User Stories

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I expect an easy to read and understand user interface so that I can use the application intuitively
- As a user, I want to enter the URL to a REST API and select the REST method to use to access it
- As a user, I want visual confirmation that my entries and selections are valid so that I have confidence the application will be able to fetch the API data that Iâ€™ve requested

And as developers, here are the high level development tasks that address the above end user requirements

- Create a visually appealing site with a Header, Footer, and a large content area
- Create a form that asks for a URL
- Create buttons that let the user choose from the REST methods (get, post, put, delete)
- When the form is filled out, and the button is clicked, display the URL and the method chosen
